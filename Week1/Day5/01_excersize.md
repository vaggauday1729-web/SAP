## 🎯 Activity 1: What is Robotics? - Your First Thoughts

### Before We Start

**When you hear "Robotics," what do you think of?**
- [ ] Physical robots
- [ ] Factory robots
- [ ] Robot vacuum cleaners
- [ ] Something complicated
- [ ] Other: ___________________________________________

**Your definition of robotics:**
> Performing tasks with higher efficiency and less errors

## 💡 Activity 2: Simple Robotics Explanation

### What is Robotics?

**Definition:** Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.

**What does this mean?**
- **Design and construction** = Making robots
- **Operation and use** = Using robots
- **Autonomously** = By themselves, without human help
- **Semi-autonomously** = Mostly by themselves, with some human help

**Simple Explanation:**
Robotics = Making and using robots that can do tasks by themselves!

**Examples:**
- Robot vacuum cleaner
- Factory assembly robots
- Medical surgery robots
- Delivery robots

**Can you think of another example?**
> Partner robot
> DIY Robots
> Logistics handling robots

## 🎨 Activity 3: Difference Between Robotics, Automation, and AI

### Understanding the Three Concepts

**ROBOTICS:**
- **Focus:** Physical robots performing tasks
- **Example:** 
  > Robovaccum

**AUTOMATION:**
- **Focus:** Can involve both software (RPA) and hardware automation, not necessarily robots
- **Example:** 
  > Automation of verfication tasks

**AI:**
- **Focus:** Intelligence and decision-making capabilities applied to various fields, including robotics
- **Example:** 
  > Robovaccums, Delivery Drones, Self driving cars

**Fill in the table:**

| Feature              | Robotics        | Automation       | AI                                                            |
|---------             |----------       |----------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Physical robot?**  | VaccuRobots     |Plug-in / Plug-out|scanning, obstacle avoiding, Suction capacity,Dry&Wet vaccuming|
| **Can be software?** | Movement        |RPA               |Chatgpt, copilot, perplexity                                   |
| **Makes decisions?** | HUmanoid robots |Approvalss        |Chatgpt, copilot, perplexity                                   |
| **Example**          | Sofia           |Workflows         |Chatgpt, copilot, perplexity                                   |

**How are they related?**
> They are all interconnected

## 🧩 Activity 4: What is Automation?

### Simple Explanation

**Definition:** Automation involves using technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention.

**What does this mean?**
- **Using technology** = Computers, software, robots
- **Perform tasks** = Do work
- **Minimal human intervention** = Little or no human help needed

**Simple Example:**
- **Manual:** You wake up, walk to coffee maker, press button, wait
- **Automated:** Coffee maker starts at 7 AM automatically

**Another Example:**
- **Manual:** You check email every hour
- **Automated:** Email app checks for you and notifies you

**Can you think of another example?**
> Alarms & reminders

## 🎯 Activity 5: Automation in Your Life

### Find Examples Around You

**1. At Home:**
- Example: Washing maschine
- What it does automatically: 
  > press button

**2. On Your Phone:**
- Example: Siri
- What it does automatically: 
  > control phone

**3. At Work/School:**
- Example: RPA
- What it does automatically: 
  > Document proofing

**4. Online:**
- Example: Gmail
- What it does automatically: 
  > Translation

## 🎮 Activity 6: Automation vs. Manual

### Compare the Two

**Task:** Paying a bill

**Manual Way:**
1. Recieving the bill
2. Check the bill
3. Pay amount
4. Collect invoice

**Automated Way:**
1. Recieve the verified bill
2. one tap payment
3. autorecieve the invoice

**Which is easier? Why?**
> Automated. It smoothens & is faster
